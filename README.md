# Trajectory-Simulation
# All codes included here are necessary for simulation.
The main file is named Analysis.m, and all other files are function. You don't need to change the code structure in the mian file unless you have a better code structure:) All simulation parameters can be found in the begining part of the main file.
It is also important to know the function files, they can be divided into two kinds. The first kind with name format like this Mode*_* .m, these files corresponding to fours steps for a single repeat cycle in mathematical model. The number indicate the step it correspond to and the letter after underline indicate the gait. The other kind of file with name format like this Plotpose_frame_*, these files are use to display trajectory.
